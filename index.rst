Welcome to Carpentries Internationalisation Handbook
====================================================

This guide documents the infrastructure to translate `the
Carpentries`_'s lessons. In here we include a translator guide using `Transifex`_
and a maintainer guide to keep everything running.

And remember! also here you should follow our `Code of Conduct`_.
