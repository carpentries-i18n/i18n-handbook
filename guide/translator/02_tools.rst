Transifex
---------

`Transifex`_ is a collaborative translation platform. You need an account to be
able to contribute to the translations.

Depending of the role you've been assigned you can translate, revise, invite new
contributors, etc.

Their `documentation on how to use the web editor`_ is short but very complete.
You should take a look to familiarise with the platform and all its advantages.

We are keeping `glossaries`_ for different languages that can be used across
different lessons to keep consistency. If you find a common term that's not
there, `add it`_!

If there's a sentence that you are not sure how to translate, or the meaning is
unclear, use the `comments and issues`_ tool. We don't have enough experience
yet to define when to create an issue or a comment, so feel free to experiment.

You can also download one or more files to `translate them offline` or from your
favourite tool (some specified below). However, be aware that you won't see if
someone is translating these files at the same time nor use the other tools that
Transifex offers. These and other problems that they say in the guide are not
going to happen too often if the lesson files are distributed between the
translators.

------

`POEDIT`_ is a multi-platform desktop software. It has support to integrate with
