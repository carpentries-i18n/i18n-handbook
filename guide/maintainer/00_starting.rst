Getting started
===============

To be the maintainer of this infrastructure doesn't require that you speak other

``jekyll``, ``sphinx``, ``python`` and ``gettext``.

Are you interested to help? Keep reading the guide and introduce yourself on the
`internationalisation slack room`_ (`or matrix`_) and search for ``DavidPS``.
